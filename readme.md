## Project Setup

1. Clone github repository on your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/syedfaysel/BeIntelligent.git
```

2. Obeserve the folder structure of the project.

```
/backend
    /node_modules
    index.js
    /models
    /utils
    package.json
    package-lock.json

/frontend
    /node_modules
    /app
    /public
    .
    .
.gitignore
readme.md
```

3. Initially you won't see the `node_modules` folder. Next thing you need to do after cloning the repo,  
   Go to the `backend` folder and run

```bash
npm i
```

It'll install all the dependecies and package needed inside the node_modules.
Do the same for `frontend` folder.

> Once done, you're ready to start working. 

## Important Instructions
1. Do not work on `main` branch or `dev` branch.
2. Work only on your particular-dev branch or feature branch. i.e `rajo-dev`, `sreya-dev`, `search-book`
3. Once a feature or portion is done (working), add `Pull Request` in github for review. 

Do the same in a loop
